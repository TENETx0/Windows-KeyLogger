 **📌 About This Project**

This project is a Windows-based keylogger designed for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and researchers to analyze keylogging behavior, test detection techniques, and enhance security awareness.

**🛠️ Setup & Usage (For Research Purposes Only!)**

🔹 Installation

```
pip install pyHook pythoncom
```

🔹 Run the Keylogger (Ethically)
```
python keylogger.py local
```
🔹 Retrieve Logs

    Check keylogs.txt for recorded keystrokes.

    If using email/FTP, logs will be sent to the configured destination.
    
🔹Fixing Errors :

**Install Pip, Swig, PyWin32 andd PyHook as Requirements before running the file**

**Pip Installation  :**

1) Ensure pip is Installed
```
python -m ensurepip --default-pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
2) Add Python and Scripts Folder to PATH
Sometimes, pip is installed but not recognized. Try thi
```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python312\Scripts\;C:\Python312\"

```
3) Then, restart PowerShell and try running:
```
pip --version 
```
**Install pyWinhook**

1) 🔧 Fix: Install SWIG & Build Tools
1️⃣ Install SWIG

You need to install SWIG manually:

    Download SWIG from the official site:
    🔗 SWIG Download

    Extract it and copy the path of the swig.exe file (e.g., C:\swigwin-4.1.1\swig.exe).

    Add SWIG to your system PATH:

        Open Environment Variables (Win + R → type "sysdm.cpl" → Advanced → Environment Variables).

        Under System Variables, find Path → Edit.

        Click New and add the path to swig.exe (e.g., C:\swigwin-4.1.1\).

        Click OK and Restart your system.

2️⃣ Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools

Since pyWinhook requires C++ compilation, install the necessary tools:

    Download and install Build Tools for Visual Studio:
    🔗 Visual Studio Build Tools

    During installation, check:

        C++ Build Tools

        Windows SDK

        MSVC v142 or v143 (depending on your system)

3️⃣ Verify SWIG Installation

Run the following in PowerShell or CMD:

```
swig -version
```

If SWIG is installed correctly, it should display the version.
4️⃣ Try Installing pyWinhook Again

Once SWIG is installed, retry installing pyWinhook:
```
pip install pyWinhook
```
